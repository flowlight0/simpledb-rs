[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/flowlight0/simpledb-rs/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/flowlight0/simpledb-rs?branch=main)

This repository is a Rust implementation of SimpleDB from the book "[Database Design and Implementation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7)" by Edward Sciore.

## Overview

The main goal of this repoistory is my own learning. The code from Chapter 3 to Chapter 15 of the book was originally implemented in Java, and I have re-implemented it in Rust. I will add the code for the exercises of each chapter when I feel like it.

## Completed excercises

I'll add the list of completed exercises here.
